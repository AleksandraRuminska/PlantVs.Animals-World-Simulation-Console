# Plant Vs. Animals World Simulation - Console

Simulated world of different animals and plants that multiply and fight for survival. The world is of fixed 40X20 size. The number of turns is given by the player. During every turn animals move and plants grow automatically, randomly choosing one of the adjacent cells. The human (if it exists) is controlled by the arrow keys and can be given a special ability - "Antelope's speed (moves two fields instead of one)" if the number "2" is pressed.

The game was created for the classes at University the same as the similar application written in Java. The code was written in C++ with ncurses library. To properly compile files "-lncurses" needs to be added at the end of the command. 

The animals and plants are represented as different characters (e.g. '(' 'W' , '&' etc.).
